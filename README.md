## Description:

A Mern-Stack web page, of course! A home page that showcases the most recent products is available to users when they log in. Additional features include a product route, as well as a button for accessing additional products. Credit cards are accepted for payment. As an administrator, you have access to all orders and products on the site. It is possible for them to add and remove items. They don't have to guess who paid for it. Once the user has paid, the admin can distribute the item. When the goods is delivered by the administrator, a notification appears in the user's My Order Dashboard. Both the administrator and the user can make changes to their personal information on my profile page at any time.
